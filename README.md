### ASSIGNMENT: CARD MATCH
I have been tasked with building a new HTML/TypeScript/SASS browser game. The objective of the game is to find all sets of matching cards within a maximum of 3 tries/attempts. There will be a total of six (6) cards flipped face down at the start. The set will include 3 pairs of matching cards. The player must try to match all three pairs of cards in fewer than 3 attempts. An attempt doesn't represent just one card flip; rather, it involves comparing 2 cards in one try. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back to their face-down state, and the player's remaining attempts are reduced by one.

At the start of each new game, the cards must reshuffle to different positions and values.
